In this Power BI dashboard, we conducted a comprehensive sales analysis by integrating and visualizing key performance metrics from our sales dataset. We calculated and displayed the total discount, quantity sold, profit, and sales to provide a clear overview of business performance. Multiple visualizations were used to break down sales data: a pie chart shows sales distribution by state, a line chart tracks sales trends by order date, and a bar chart ranks sales by sub-category. Additionally, we used pie and donut charts to illustrate sales by customer segment and region, respectively. Interactive filters were implemented to allow users to dynamically explore the data by various fields such as category, city, region, and product, enabling deeper insights and targeted analysis. This approach ensures that stakeholders can easily identify top-performing areas and make informed, data-driven decisions
